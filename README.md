## About ScaleX

ScaleX is my hands-on lab to architect **modern Android apps** designed to scale — built for teams
of hundreds or thousands, handling complex features, concurrency, networking, and modularization.

- Building **modular Android app architectures** using best practices (e.g., feature modules, clean
  architecture)
- Designing **robust networking layers** with concurrency and retry mechanisms
- Integrating **Android-centric observability** tools like Firebase Performance Monitoring and
  Crashlytics for real-world app metrics
- Optimizing **UI performance**: frame rendering, startup time, memory & battery usage
- Managing **multi-module Gradle builds** for fast iteration and scalable development
- Experimenting with **scalable app patterns** common in large Android teams

---

## What You’ll Find Here

- Android app modules with clear boundaries (`app`, `features`, `core`, `networkSdk`)
- Examples of concurrency and network request orchestration on Android
- Integration of Android observability tools capturing **latency, error rates, and stability metrics
  **
- Gradle build logic and performance optimizations for Android projects
- Sample features demonstrating modularization and scalable app design

---

## Getting Started

1. Clone and open the project in **Android Studio**
2. Build and run the `app` module on an emulator or device
3. Explore key modules for architecture insights:
    - `core`: common components and concurrency models
    - `features`: independent feature modules
    - `networkSdk`: network request handling with OkHttp
4. Review the [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) for upcoming enhancements focusing on Android app scalability
