## 🗺️ Roadmap

**Objective**: Enable scalable, observable, and consistent architecture to support developers across
modular product teams.

### 1. 🚦 Modular Navigation Framework

- Declarative APIs with typed screen contracts
- Gradle plugin for automatic screen registration
- Zero-boilerplate integration for feature teams

### 2. 🧩 Standardized Dependency Injection

- Predefined DI modules for platform services (analytics, logging, etc.)
- Gradle plugin to enforce DI setup and reduce config drift
- Unified scopes across UI, service, and domain layers

### 3. 📊 Latency & Analytics Instrumentation

- Navigation lifecycle metrics (TTI, TTFB, dwell time)
- Team-tagged analytics emitters
- Auto-generated dashboards and alerts

### 4. 🤖 ML-Powered Jank & Anomaly Detection

- Lightweight on-device jank profiler
- Offline ML pipeline for anomaly classification
- Automated weekly regression reports

### 5. 🎨 Design System Enforcement

- Centralized design tokens synced from Figma
- Shared composable component library
- UI linting + runtime audits for consistency

### 6. 🛠️ Developer Experience at Scale

- Code generation for navigation, DI, and analytics
- Monorepo tooling for visibility into dependencies and build health
